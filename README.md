# [Segmentation-and-Clustering](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com/files/ibm/neighborhoods_in_toronto)
Segmenting and Clustering Neighbourhoods in Toronto The project includes scraping the Wikipedia page for the postal codes of Canada and then process and clean the data for the clustering. The clustering is carried out by K Means and the clusters are plotted using the Folium Library. The Boroughs containing the name 'Toronto' in it are first plotted and then clustered and plotted again.

All the 3 tasks of web scraping, cleaning and clustering are implemented in the same notebook for the ease of evaluation. Installing and Importing the required Libraries In [2]: !pip install beautifulsoup4 !pip install lxml import requests # library to handle requests import pandas as pd # library for data analsysis import numpy as np # library to handle data in a vectorized manner import random # library for random number generation

#!conda install -c conda-forge geopy --yes from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim # module to convert an address into latitude and longitude values

libraries for displaying images
from IPython.display import Image from IPython.core.display import HTML

from IPython.display import display_html import pandas as pd import numpy as np

tranforming json file into a pandas dataframe library
